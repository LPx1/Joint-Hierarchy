# Joint-Hierarchy

Project can create joints represented as spheres and planes. The joints can be created with or without a parent being able to move freely with any relation to a parent joint. When parent joints are translated or rotated, so are the child joints within its hierarchy. Child joints may move freely as a normal joint. 

The project also has a save and load file function to allow for saving current joint hierarchies.
